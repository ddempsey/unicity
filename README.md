# unicity

This library provides tools for testing code contained in large batches of quite similar Python files. It also performs comparisons of code in the different files, highlighting groups of high similarity.

I wrote the library to speed up marking of Python assignments for a programming course, and to detect copying. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install unicity
```

## Getting started

Download the examples folder and run the test cases in loading_projects.py, batch_testing.py and similarity_check.py.
